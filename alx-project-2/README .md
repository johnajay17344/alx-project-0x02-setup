## Introduction

This repository contains the initial setup and foundational structure for a modern web application using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

It is part of a learning project aimed at understanding how to:

- Configure a Next.js project with TypeScript.
- Style components using Tailwind CSS.
- Create reusable UI components.
- Implement client-side and server-side routing.
- Integrate with external APIs.
- Maintain a clean and scalable project structure.

This is the starting point for building out a complete, interactive web application using best practices in modern frontend development.
